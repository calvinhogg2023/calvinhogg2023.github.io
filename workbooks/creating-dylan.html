					<div class="divider"></div>
					<p class="workbook-heading">Overview and Research Statement</p>
					<p class="workbook-paragraph">
						Unlike semester one, which involved developing a video game, this major project will be more relevant to my creative field of interest.
						<br><br>
						In 2018, my specialty was photography, but this didn’t evolve much as my interest was mainly in the technical aspects, and the cost of equipment was off-putting.
						<br><br>
						The project I propose for this semester is a 3D rendered character that resembles a real person. Hopefully by the end the skill and effort put into it will make the character easily recognizable.
						<br><br>
						As shown later in this workbook, I have a very basic understanding of creating CGI characters, so in order to make this project better than the examples shown, a lot of time will be spent researching better ways of modelling, texturing and rigging, as well as basic studies of anatomy and expressions. Another important area of research will be observing the person’s most noticeable characteristics and mannerisms.
						<br><br>
						Specific skills I’m aware I have no experience with are using specialized software such as Substance Painter and Mari, material attributes such as subsurface scattering, and both body and facial rigging.
					</p>
					<p class="workbook-heading">Relevant Work and Practitioners</p>
					<p class="workbook-paragraph">
						When researching similar media, I remembered a film released a few years ago that had CGI recreations of the Queen and Donald Trump, called The Queen’s Corgi. I’ve only seen the trailer, but the modelers have done an okay job. The art style is simplistic, but the point is they’re recognizable.
						<br><br>
						3D artist George Siskas has also made a passion out of recreating people in CGI. Pictured here are Daniel Craig (James Bond) and Walter White (Breaking Bad).
						<br><br>
						Useful websites where people publish 3D art are ArtStation and ZBrush Central.
						<br><br>
						Also pictured here are recreations of the sci-fi character I made last year and of Dylan Nathaniel-Jones.
						<br><br>
						The sci-fi character remake was initially made in October 2021 alongside the Applied Media artefact. The January 2022 revision adds basic eyelids, nostrils and ears, as well as better topology for the neck.
						<br><br>
						While the Dylan recreation shows notable facial improvements, it could’ve been a lot better. Side-by-side, it lacks Dylan’s eye bags, puffy lips, ears and hair. Had I focused on adding these small details, I’m sure anyone familiar with Dylan would’ve been able to recognize him more easily.
					</p>
					<p class="workbook-heading">Exhibition</p>
					<p class="workbook-paragraph">
						The plan for exhibiting this project will be professionally printing and framing the finished render of the character and displaying it in the Te Auaha gallery.
						<br><br>
						I already have an A4 frame, pictured here, along with a proportionatelyaccurate recreation so I can easily measure the best mat board opening and the print size option needed from the list shown. As depicted by the green outline, the photo itself will be 229x152 mm, meaning at a standard resolution of 300ppi, the image will need to be rendered at 2704x1796 pixels.
						<br><br>
						The framed photo might also be accompanied by a small description card (similar to those at museums and other galleries).
						<br><br>
						In addition, a video might be made that shows the developmental process behind the character, for instance sculpting and animating. This will be useful for a bachelor student compilation if such a thing exists.
					</p>
					<p class="workbook-heading">Budget</p>
					<p class="workbook-paragraph">
						The digital side of the project will involve the use of Adobe’s Creative Cloud, specifically Photoshop for image manipulation and texturing, InDesign for creating these workbooks, Substance Painter for texturing, Blender for digital sculpting, Autodesk Maya for modelling, rigging and animating, and RenderMan for the final render. I have access to all of this software for free, thanks to student and non-commercial plans.
						<br><br>
						The physical side will involve the cost of printing the rendered image, the mat board and the foam core. These resources can be processed with the help of Photo Warehouse and Gordon Harris. Pictured here is a list of sizes Photo Warehouse supports.
						<br><br>
						As mentioned in the exhibition section, the cost of the print will be $2.90 for the 152x229 mm option, the cost of the mat board will be $6.50 for the 40x50 mm option, and the cost of the foam board will be $2.50 for the 5 mm A4 option.
						<br><br>
						The total cost of all resources will be $11.90.

					<p class="workbook-paragraph">
						Rather than being limited to a front and side view of Dylan to recreate him in 3D, I had hundreds of photos from various angles that I had previously used for a photogrammetry experiment. This meant I was able to measure the right proportions in 3D software and get a detailed look at his face.
						<br><br>
						This scanned model in the top-left would form the foundation of the sculpt which I explain on the next page.
					</p>
					<p class="workbook-heading">Sculpting</p>
					<p class="workbook-paragraph">
						Using the photogrammetry model of Dylan’s head for reference, I created a few spheres in Blender and sculpted them into shape. My preferred software for 3D is Autodesk Maya, but I find the navigation in Blender to work better with a graphics tablet, which I needed to sculpt the fine details.
						<br><br>
						The reason for sculpting only half of his face is so that I could flip it around later and ensure both sides were symmetrical.
						<br><br>
						The final polycount for the sculpt was around 400,000 faces, but in order to make it easier to animate I would need to recreate the shape by placing polygons in a cleaner formation, a process called retopology.
					</p>
					<p class="workbook-heading">Retopology</p>
					<p class="workbook-paragraph">
						The idea behind retopology is to create a cleaner mesh that can be more easily controlled and animated compared to a sculpt. Pictured in the top-left is an example of good head topology by an artist name Nazar Noschenko. He’s highlighted various sections of the face in different colours, with a key similarity between them being the “fivepoint stars” at the corners. These redirect the edge flow which allows the face to deform in a way that resembles muscle movements in real life.
					</p>
					<p class="workbook-heading">Texturing</p>
					<p class="workbook-paragraph">
						At this point I hadn’t got around to learning Substance Painter, so after UV unwrapping the retopologized head, I brought the guide into Photoshop and using the brush tool, painted some lips, nostrils and cheeks, as well as shaded areas for the eyelids and hair.
					</p>
					<p class="workbook-heading">Hair and Cloth Simulation</p>
					<p class="workbook-paragraph">
						Just like at the start of the year in a practice Cyberthug render, I used XGen to simulate Dylan’s hair, as this time around he wouldn’t have a beanie to hide the lack of it. There are different ways to create hair using XGen, as seen in the dialog box, and by connecting it to Maya’s nHair system, I might be able to make it be affected by gravity and physics.

						<br><br>
						Cloth simulation is still to come. This would likely be a simple shirt or hoodie, as the final render would be of the head and shoulders. Depending on the success of the hair, Dylan’s beanie might make another appearance as a simple geometric object.
					</p>
					<p class="workbook-heading">Professional Printing Tests</p>
					<p class="workbook-paragraph">
						Toward the end of July I had printed the Mount Victoria render from earlier this year in both matte and glossy formats to see how they compare. Behind the frame’s glass panel, the glossy photo would’ve introduced a second reflection, which I figured might be distracting and unpleasant to look at.
						<br><br>
						I was led to believe from online research that the sharpness and colour would be better with the glossy print, but in reality they turned out identical. To test the limits, I over-saturated the render and saved it in the Adobe RGB colour space before sending it through to Photo Warehouse on Victoria St.
					</p>
					<p class="workbook-heading">Mid-Project Reflection</p>
					<p class="workbook-paragraph">
						Comparing the version of Dylan in this project with the one used in semester 1’s Applied Media, there’s noticeable improvement to both the geometry and texturing. In the lead-up to assignment 3, I’ll ask Dylan for feedback, as he knows his face better than anyone.
						<br><br>
						What works:
						<br>
						- I’m particularly impressed with how the nose has improved this time around, with a more clearly-defined shape that’s almost identical to the reference.
						<br>
						- The eyebrows are more realistic and angular, which fits with Dylan’s ones, even if they are a bit too thick. Despite being just a simple diffuse texture (same as before), they seem to have more depth to them.
						<br><br>
						What could be improved:
						<br>
						- Something about Dylan’s lips looks a bit off. When asking several people for feedback, two of them noted there was too much distance between the nose and lips. I think the colour, shape and specularity of them could be better.
